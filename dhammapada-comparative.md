# The Dhammapada - Comparison of Pali to English Translations

This document is part of my notes used in creating a new, gender neutral, plain language version of the Dhammapada. The starting point for my project is the 19th century translation by F. Max Müller which is available on Project Gutenberg, but my intention is to incorporate thinking from other translators as well, rather than rely on Müller's assumptions.

Here I am contrasting the Müller version with more recent translations by Buddhist scholars who have gone back to the original Pali and have different interpretations of many words as well as dramatically different approaches to structuring the verses in English.

Please consider the use of the non-Müller versions here as fair use. Included for their value in interpreting the text via comparison and in the spirit of their status as gifts of dhamma.

## Versions used:

* **[PALI]** The Pali versions of each verse are taken from the **[TIN]** version, which states "The Pali text used is the Dhammapada Pali approved by the Sixth International Buddhist Synod"
* **[MÜLLER]** [Dhammapada, a Collection of Verses; Being One of the Canonical Books of the Buddhists](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2017) Translated by F. Max Müller

* **[JER]** Where there is a **[JER]** version of a verse this indicates I have created my version, gender neutral and plain language, and added it with the others.

## 1. Yamakavagga
* **[MÜLLER]** The Twin-Verses
* **[TIN]** Yamakavagga
* **[THANISSARO]** Pairs

### 1 Cakkhupalatthera Vatthu

**[PALI]**
Manopubbangama dhamma //
manosettha manomaya //
manasa ce padutthena //
bhasati va karoti va //
tato nam dukkhamanveti //
cakkamva vahato padam.

**[MÜLLER]** All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the carriage.

**[TIN]** All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind as their chief; they are mind-made. If one speaks or acts with an evil mind, 'dukkha' follows him just as the wheel follows the hoofprint of the ox that draws the cart.

**[THANISSARO]** Phenomena are   preceded by the heart, //
	ruled by the heart, //
	made of the heart. //
If you speak or act //
with a corrupted heart, //
then suffering follows you — //
as the wheel of the cart, //
	the track of the ox //
	that pulls it.

**[JER]** All that we are is preceded by the mind (mano): ruled by the mind, made up of the mind. If you speak or act with an impure mind, suffering (dukkha) will follow you, like the wheel follows the hoofprint of the ox that pulls the cart.

### 2 Matthakundali Vatthu

**[PALI]** Manopubbangama dhamma //
manosettha manomaya //
manasa ce pasannena //
bhasati va karoti va //
tato nam sukha manveti //
chayava anapayini.

**[MÜLLER]** All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never leaves him.

**[TIN]** All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind as their chief; they are mind-made. If one speaks or acts with a pure mind, happiness (sukha) follows him like a shadow that never leaves him.

**[THANISSARO]** Phenomena are  preceded by the heart, //
	ruled by the heart, //
	made of the heart. //
If you speak or act //
with a calm, bright heart, //
then happiness follows you, //
like a shadow //
	that never leaves.

**[JER]** All that we are is preceded by the mind (mano): ruled by the mind, made up of the mind. If you speak or act with a pure mind, happiness (sukha) will follow you, like a shadow that never leaves.

### 3 Tissatthera Vatthu

**[PALI]** Akkocchi mam avadhi mam //
ajini mam ahasi me //
ye ca tam upanayhanti //
veram tesam na sammati.

**[MÜLLER]** "He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,"--in those who harbour such thoughts hatred will never cease.

**[TIN]** "He abused me, he ill-treated me, he got the better of me, he stole my belongings;"... the enmity of those harbouring such thoughts cannot be appeased.

**[THANISSARO]** 'He	insulted me, //
	hit me, //
	beat me, //
	robbed me' //
 — for those who brood on this, //
	hostility isn't stilled.

**[JER]** "They abused me, they beat me, they defeated me, they robbed me"--in those who harbour such thoughts hatred will never cease.

### 4 Tissatthera Vatthu

**[PALI]** Akkocchi mam avadhi mam //
ajini mam ahasi me //
ye ca tam nupanayhanti //
veram tesupasammati.

**[MÜLLER]** "He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,"--in those who do not harbour such thoughts hatred will cease.

**[TIN]** "He abused me, he ill-treated me, he got the better of me, he stole my belongings;"... the enmity of those not harbouring such thoughts can be appeased.

**[THANISSARO]** 'He insulted me, //
hit me, //
beat me, //
robbed me' — //
for those who don't brood on this, //
	hostility is stilled.

**[JER]** "They abused me, they beat me, they defeated me, they robbed me"--in those who do not harbour such thoughts hatred will cease.

### 5 Kalayakkhini Vatthu

**[PALI]** Na hi verena verani //
sammantidha kudacanam //
averena ca sammanti //
esa dhammo sanantano.

**[MÜLLER]** For hatred does not cease by hatred at any time: hatred ceases by love, this is an old rule.

**[TIN]** Hatred is, indeed, never appeased by hatred in this world. It is appeased only by loving-kindness. This is an ancient law.

**[THANISSARO]** Hostilities aren't stilled //
	through hostility, //
	regardless. //
Hostilities are stilled //
through non-hostility: //
	this, an unending truth.

**[JER]** For hatred is never appeased by hatred, It is appeased by loving-kindness. This is an old rule.

### 6 Kosambaka Vatthu

**[PALI]** Pare ca na vijananti //
mayamettha yamamase //
ye ca tattha vijananti //
tato sammanti medhaga.

**[MÜLLER]** The world does not know that we must all come to an end here;--but those who know it, their quarrels cease at once.

**[TIN]** People, other than the wise, do not realize, "We in this world must all die," (and, not realizing it, continue their quarrels). The wise realize it and thereby their quarrels cease.

**[THANISSARO]** Unlike those who don't realize //
that we're here on the verge //
	of perishing, //
those who do: //
	their quarrels are stilled.

**[JER]** Unlike for those who do not understand that we all must die, for those who do understand this, all quarrels cease.

### 7 Mahakalatthera Vatthu

**[PALI]** Subhanupassim viharantam //
indriyesu asamvutam //
bhojanamhi camattannum //
kusitam hinaviriyam //
tam ve pasahati Maro //
vato rukkhamva dubbalam.

**[MÜLLER]** He who lives looking for pleasures only, his senses uncontrolled, immoderate in his food, idle, and weak, Mara (the tempter) will certainly overthrow him, as the wind throws down a weak tree.

**[TIN]** He who keeps his mind on pleasant objects, who is uncontrolled in his senses, immoderate in his food, and is lazy and lacking in energy, will certainly be overwhelmed by Mara,3 just as stormy winds uproot a weak tree.

**[THANISSARO]** One who stays focused on the beautiful, //
is unrestrained with the senses, //
knowing no moderation in food, //
apathetic, unenergetic: //
	Mara overcomes him //
	as the wind, a weak tree.

**[JER]** If you stay focused on pleasant things, uncontrolled in your senses, immoderate in diet, idle and lacking energy, you will certainly be overwhelmed by Mara (temptation), just as the wind uproots a weak tree.

### 8 Mahakalatthera Vatthu

**[PALI]** Asubhanupassim viharantam //
indriyesu susamvutam //
bhojanamhi ca mattannum //
saddham2 araddhaviriyam //
tam ve nappasahati Maro //
vato selamva pabbatam.

**[MÜLLER]** He who lives without looking for pleasures, his senses well controlled, moderate in his food, faithful and strong, him Mara will certainly not overthrow, any more than the wind throws down a rocky mountain.

**[TIN]** He who keeps his mind on the impurities (of the body), who is well-controlled in his senses and is full of faith and energy, will certainly be not overwhelmed by Mara, just as stormy winds cannot shake a mountain of rock.

**[THANISSARO]** One who stays focused on the foul, //
is restrained with regard to the senses, //
knowing moderation in food, //
full of conviction & energy: //
	Mara does not overcome him //
	as the wind, a mountain of rock.

**[JER]** If you stay focused on impurities and the foul, are well controlled in your senses, moderate in diet, full of faith and energy, you will certainly not be overwhelmed by Mara (temptation), just as the wind cannot shake a mountain of rock.

### 9

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who wishes to put on the yellow dress without having cleansed himself from sin, who disregards temperance and truth, is unworthy of the yellow dress.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 10

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** But he who has cleansed himself from sin, is well grounded in all virtues, and regards also temperance and truth, he is indeed worthy of the yellow dress.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 11

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** They who imagine truth in untruth, and see untruth in truth, never arrive at truth, but follow vain desires.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 12

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** They who know truth in truth, and untruth in untruth, arrive at truth, and follow true desires.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 13

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As rain breaks through an ill-thatched house, passion will break through an unreflecting mind.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 14

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As rain does not break through a well-thatched house, passion will not break through a well-reflecting mind.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 15

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The evil-doer mourns in this world, and he mourns in the next; he mourns in both. He mourns and suffers when he sees the evil of his own work.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 16

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The virtuous man delights in this world, and he delights in the next; he delights in both. He delights and rejoices, when he sees the purity of his own work.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 17

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The evil-doer suffers in this world, and he suffers in the next; he suffers in both. He suffers when he thinks of the evil he has done; he suffers more when going on the evil path.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 18

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The virtuous man is happy in this world, and he is happy in the
  next; he is happy in both. He is happy when he thinks of the good he has
  done; he is still more happy when going on the good path.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 19

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The thoughtless man, even if he can recite a large portion (of the
  law), but is not a doer of it, has no share in the priesthood, but is
  like a cowherd counting the cows of others.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  ## 20

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The follower of the law, even if he can recite only a small portion
  (of the law), but, having forsaken passion and hatred and foolishness,
  possesses true knowledge and serenity of mind, he, caring for nothing in
  this world or that to come, has indeed a share in the priesthood.

  ## 2. On Earnestness

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  ## 21

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Earnestness is the path of immortality (Nirvana), thoughtlessness
  the path of death. Those who are in earnest do not die, those who are
  thoughtless are as if dead already.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 22

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Those who are advanced in earnestness, having understood this
  clearly, delight in earnestness, and rejoice in the knowledge of the
  Ariyas (the elect).

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 23

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** These wise people, meditative, steady, always possessed of strong
  powers, attain to Nirvana, the highest happiness.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 24

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If an earnest person has roused himself, if he is not forgetful,
  if his deeds are pure, if he acts with consideration, if he restrains
  himself, and lives according to law,--then his glory will increase.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 25

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** By rousing himself, by earnestness, by restraint and control, the
  wise man may make for himself an island which no flood can overwhelm.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 26

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Fools follow after vanity, men of evil wisdom. The wise man keeps
  earnestness as his best jewel.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 27

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Follow not after vanity, nor after the enjoyment of love and lust!
  He who is earnest and meditative, obtains ample joy.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 28

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** When the learned man drives away vanity by earnestness, he, the
  wise, climbing the terraced heights of wisdom, looks down upon the
  fools, serene he looks upon the toiling crowd, as one that stands on a
  mountain looks down upon them that stand upon the plain.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 29

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Earnest among the thoughtless, awake among the sleepers, the wise
  man advances like a racer, leaving behind the hack.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 30

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** By earnestness did Maghavan (Indra) rise to the lordship of the
  gods. People praise earnestness; thoughtlessness is always blamed.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 31

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in earnestness, who looks with
  fear on thoughtlessness, moves about like fire, burning all his fetters,
  small or large.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 32

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in reflection, who looks with
  fear on thoughtlessness, cannot fall away (from his perfect state)--he
  is close upon Nirvana.

  ## 3. Thought

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 33

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As a fletcher makes straight his arrow, a wise man makes straight
  his trembling and unsteady thought, which is difficult to guard,
  difficult to hold back.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 34

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As a fish taken from his watery home and thrown on dry ground, our
  thought trembles all over in order to escape the dominion of Mara (the
  tempter).

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 35

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** It is good to tame the mind, which is difficult to hold in and
  flighty, rushing wherever it listeth; a tamed mind brings happiness.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 36

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let the wise man guard his thoughts, for they are difficult to
  perceive, very artful, and they rush wherever they list: thoughts well
  guarded bring happiness.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 37

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Those who bridle their mind which travels far, moves about alone,
  is without a body, and hides in the chamber (of the heart), will be free
  from the bonds of Mara (the tempter).

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 38

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man's thoughts are unsteady, if he does not know the true law,
  if his peace of mind is troubled, his knowledge will never be perfect.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 39

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man's thoughts are not dissipated, if his mind is not
  perplexed, if he has ceased to think of good or evil, then there is no
  fear for him while he is watchful.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 40

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Knowing that this body is (fragile) like a jar, and making this
  thought firm like a fortress, one should attack Mara (the tempter) with
  the weapon of knowledge, one should watch him when conquered, and should
  never rest.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 41

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Before long, alas! this body will lie on the earth, despised,
  without understanding, like a useless log.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 42

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Whatever a hater may do to a hater, or an enemy to an enemy, a
  wrongly-directed mind will do us greater mischief.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 43

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Not a mother, not a father will do so much, nor any other relative;
  a well-directed mind will do us greater service.

  ## 4. Flowers

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 44

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Who shall overcome this earth, and the world of Yama (the lord of
  the departed), and the world of the gods? Who shall find out the plainly
  shown path of virtue, as a clever man finds out the (right) flower?

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 45

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The disciple will overcome the earth, and the world of Yama, and the
  world of the gods. The disciple will find out the plainly shown path of
  virtue, as a clever man finds out the (right) flower.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 46

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who knows that this body is like froth, and has learnt that it
  is as unsubstantial as a mirage, will break the flower-pointed arrow of
  Mara, and never see the king of death.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 47

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Death carries off a man who is gathering flowers and whose mind is
  distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 48

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Death subdues a man who is gathering flowers, and whose mind is
  distracted, before he is satiated in his pleasures.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 49

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As the bee collects nectar and departs without injuring the flower,
  or its colour or scent, so let a sage dwell in his village.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 50

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Not the perversities of others, not their sins of commission or
  omission, but his own misdeeds and negligences should a sage take notice
  of.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 51

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Like a beautiful flower, full of colour, but without scent, are the
  fine but fruitless words of him who does not act accordingly.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 52

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** But, like a beautiful flower, full of colour and full of scent, are
  the fine and fruitful words of him who acts accordingly.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 53

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As many kinds of wreaths can be made from a heap of flowers, so many
  good things may be achieved by a mortal when once he is born.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 54

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The scent of flowers does not travel against the wind, nor (that
  of) sandal-wood, or of Tagara and Mallika flowers; but the odour of good
  people travels even against the wind; a good man pervades every place.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 55

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Sandal-wood or Tagara, a lotus-flower, or a Vassiki, among these
  sorts of perfumes, the perfume of virtue is unsurpassed.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 56

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Mean is the scent that comes from Tagara and sandal-wood;--the
  perfume of those who possess virtue rises up to the gods as the highest.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 57

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Of the people who possess these virtues, who live without
  thoughtlessness, and who are emancipated through true knowledge, Mara,
  the tempter, never finds the way.

**58 59** As on a heap of rubbish cast upon the highway the lily will
  grow full of sweet perfume and delight, thus the disciple of the truly
  enlightened Buddha shines forth by his knowledge among those who are
  like rubbish, among the people that walk in darkness.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  ## 5. The Fool


### 60

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Long is the night to him who is awake; long is a mile to him who is
  tired; long is life to the foolish who do not know the true law.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 61

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a traveller does not meet with one who is his better, or
  his equal, let him firmly keep to his solitary journey; there is no
  companionship with a fool.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 62

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** "These sons belong to me, and this wealth belongs to me," with such
  thoughts a fool is tormented. He himself does not belong to himself; how
  much less sons and wealth?

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 63

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The fool who knows his foolishness, is wise at least so far. But a
  fool who thinks himself wise, he is called a fool indeed.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 64

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a fool be associated with a wise man even all his life, he will
  perceive the truth as little as a spoon perceives the taste of soup.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 65

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If an intelligent man be associated for one minute only with a wise
  man, he will soon perceive the truth, as the tongue perceives the taste
  of soup.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 66

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Fools of little understanding have themselves for their greatest
  enemies, for they do evil deeds which must bear bitter fruits.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 67

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** That deed is not well done of which a man must repent, and the
  reward of which he receives crying and with a tearful face.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 68

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** No, that deed is well done of which a man does not repent, and the
  reward of which he receives gladly and cheerfully.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 69

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As long as the evil deed done does not bear fruit, the fool thinks
  it is like honey; but when it ripens, then the fool suffers grief.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 70

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let a fool month after month eat his food (like an ascetic) with the
  tip of a blade of Kusa grass, yet he is not worth the sixteenth particle
  of those who have well weighed the law.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 71

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** An evil deed, like newly-drawn milk, does not turn (suddenly);
  smouldering, like fire covered by ashes, it follows the fool.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 72

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** And when the evil deed, after it has become known, brings sorrow to
  the fool, then it destroys his bright lot, nay, it cleaves his head.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 73

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let the fool wish for a false reputation, for precedence among the
  Bhikshus, for lordship in the convents, for worship among other people!

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 74

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** "May both the layman and he who has left the world think that this
  is done by me; may they be subject to me in everything which is to be
  done or is not to be done," thus is the mind of the fool, and his desire
  and pride increase.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 75

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** "One is the road that leads to wealth, another the road that leads
  to Nirvana;" if the Bhikshu, the disciple of Buddha, has learnt this,
  he will not yearn for honour, he will strive after separation from the
  world.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  ## 6. The Wise Man (Pandita)

### 76

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If you see an intelligent man who tells you where true treasures are
  to be found, who shows what is to be avoided, and administers reproofs,
  follow that wise man; it will be better, not worse, for those who follow
  him.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 77

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let him admonish, let him teach, let him forbid what is
  improper!--he will be beloved of the good, by the bad he will be hated.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 78

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Do not have evil-doers for friends, do not have low people for
  friends: have virtuous people for friends, have for friends the best of
  men.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 79

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who drinks in the law lives happily with a serene mind: the sage
  rejoices always in the law, as preached by the elect (Ariyas).

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 80

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like); fletchers bend the
  arrow; carpenters bend a log of wood; wise people fashion themselves.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 81

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind, wise people falter not
  amidst blame and praise.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 82

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Wise people, after they have listened to the laws, become serene,
  like a deep, smooth, and still lake.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 83

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Good people walk on whatever befall, the good do not prattle,
  longing for pleasure; whether touched by happiness or sorrow wise people
  never appear elated or depressed.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 84

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If, whether for his own sake, or for the sake of others, a man
  wishes neither for a son, nor for wealth, nor for lordship, and if he
  does not wish for his own success by unfair means, then he is good,
  wise, and virtuous.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 85

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Few are there among men who arrive at the other shore (become
  Arhats); the other people here run up and down the shore.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 86

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** But those who, when the law has been well preached to them, follow
  the law, will pass across the dominion of death, however difficult to
  overcome.

**87 88** A wise man should leave the dark state (of ordinary life), and
  follow the bright state (of the Bhikshu). After going from his home to
  a homeless state, he should in his retirement look for enjoyment where
  there seemed to be no enjoyment. Leaving all pleasures behind, and
  calling nothing his own, the wise man should purge himself from all the
  troubles of the mind.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 89

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Those whose mind is well grounded in the (seven) elements of
  knowledge, who without clinging to anything, rejoice in freedom from
  attachment, whose appetites have been conquered, and who are full of
  light, are free (even) in this world.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  ## 7. The Venerable (Arhat).

### 90

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** There is no suffering for him who has finished his journey, and
  abandoned grief, who has freed himself on all sides, and thrown off all
  fetters.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 91

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** They depart with their thoughts well-collected, they are not happy
  in their abode; like swans who have left their lake, they leave their
  house and home.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 92

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Men who have no riches, who live on recognised food, who have
  perceived void and unconditioned freedom (Nirvana), their path is
  difficult to understand, like that of birds in the air.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 93

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He whose appetites are stilled, who is not absorbed in enjoyment,
  who has perceived void and unconditioned freedom (Nirvana), his path is
  difficult to understand, like that of birds in the air.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 94

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The gods even envy him whose senses, like horses well broken in by
  the driver, have been subdued, who is free from pride, and free from
  appetites.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 95

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Such a one who does his duty is tolerant like the earth, like
  Indra's bolt; he is like a lake without mud; no new births are in store
  for him.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 96

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** His thought is quiet, quiet are his word and deed, when he has
  obtained freedom by true knowledge, when he has thus become a quiet man.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The man who is free from credulity, but knows the uncreated, who has
  cut all ties, removed all temptations, renounced all desires, he is the
  greatest of men.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 98

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** In a hamlet or in a forest, in the deep water or on the dry land,
  wherever venerable persons (Arhanta) dwell, that place is delightful.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 99

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Forests are delightful; where the world finds no delight, there the
  passionless will find delight, for they look not for pleasures.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  ## 8. The Thousands

### 100

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Even though a speech be a thousand (of words), but made up of
  senseless words, one word of sense is better, which if a man hears, he
  becomes quiet.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 101

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Even though a Gatha (poem) be a thousand (of words), but made up of

  becomes quiet.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 102

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Though a man recite a hundred Gathas made up of senseless words,
  one word of the law is better, which if a man hears, he becomes quiet.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 103

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If one man conquer in battle a thousand times thousand men, and if
  another conquer himself, he is the greatest of conquerors.

**104 105** One's own self conquered is better than all other people; not
  even a god, a Gandharva, not Mara with Brahman could change into defeat
  the victory of a man who has vanquished himself, and always lives under
  restraint.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 106

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man for a hundred years sacrifice month after month with a
  thousand, and if he but for one moment pay homage to a man whose soul is
  grounded (in true knowledge), better is that homage than sacrifice for a
  hundred years.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 107

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man for a hundred years worship Agni (fire) in the forest, and
  if he but for one moment pay homage to a man whose soul is grounded
  (in true knowledge), better is that homage than sacrifice for a hundred
  years.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 108

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Whatever a man sacrifice in this world as an offering or as an
  oblation for a whole year in order to gain merit, the whole of it is
  not worth a quarter (a farthing); reverence shown to the righteous is
  better.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 109

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who always greets and constantly reveres the aged, four things
  will increase to him, viz. life, beauty, happiness, power.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 110

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** But he who lives a hundred years, vicious and unrestrained, a life
  of one day is better if a man is virtuous and reflecting.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 111

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** And he who lives a hundred years, ignorant and unrestrained, a life
  of one day is better if a man is wise and reflecting.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 112

  is better if a man has attained firm strength.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 113

  life of one day is better if a man sees beginning and end.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 114

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** And he who lives a hundred years, not seeing the immortal place, a
  life of one day is better if a man sees the immortal place.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 115

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** And he who lives a hundred years, not seeing the highest law, a
  life of one day is better if a man sees the highest law.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  ## 9. Evil

### 116

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man would hasten towards the good, he should keep his thought
  away from evil; if a man does what is good slothfully, his mind delights
  in evil.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 117

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man commits a sin, let him not do it again; let him not
  delight in sin: pain is the outcome of evil.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 118

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man does what is good, let him do it again; let him delight in
  it: happiness is the outcome of good.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 119

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Even an evil-doer sees happiness as long as his evil deed has not
  ripened; but when his evil deed has ripened, then does the evil-doer see
  evil.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 120

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Even a good man sees evil days, as long as his good deed has not
  ripened; but when his good deed has ripened, then does the good man see
  happy days.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 121

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let no man think lightly of evil, saying in his heart, It will not
  come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is
  filled; the fool becomes full of evil, even if he gather it little by
  little.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 122

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let no man think lightly of good, saying in his heart, It will not
  come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is
  filled; the wise man becomes full of good, even if he gather it little
  by little.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 123

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let a man avoid evil deeds, as a merchant, if he has few companions
  and carries much wealth, avoids a dangerous road; as a man who loves
  life avoids poison.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 124

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who has no wound on his hand, may touch poison with his hand;
  poison does not affect one who has no wound; nor is there evil for one
  who does not commit evil.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 125

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man offend a harmless, pure, and innocent person, the evil
  falls back upon that fool, like light dust thrown up against the wind.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 126

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Some people are born again; evil-doers go to hell; righteous
  people go to heaven; those who are free from all worldly desires attain
  Nirvana.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 127

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Not in the sky, not in the midst of the sea, not if we enter into
  the clefts of the mountains, is there known a spot in the whole world
  where death could not overcome (the mortal).

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  ## 10. Punishment

### 129

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** All men tremble at punishment, all men fear death; remember that
  you are like unto them, and do not kill, nor cause slaughter.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 130

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** All men tremble at punishment, all men love life; remember that
  thou art like unto them, and do not kill, nor cause slaughter.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 131

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who seeking his own happiness punishes or kills beings who also
  long for happiness, will not find happiness after death.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 132

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who seeking his own happiness does not punish or kill beings who
  also long for happiness, will find happiness after death.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 133

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Do not speak harshly to anybody; those who are spoken to will
  answer thee in the same way. Angry speech is painful, blows for blows
  will touch thee.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 134

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If, like a shattered metal plate (gong), thou utter not, then thou
  hast reached Nirvana; contention is not known to thee.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 135

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As a cowherd with his staff drives his cows into the stable, so do
  Age and Death drive the life of men.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 136

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A fool does not know when he commits his evil deeds: but the wicked
  man burns by his own deeds, as if burnt by fire.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 137

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who inflicts pain on innocent and harmless persons, will soon
  come to one of these ten states:

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 138

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He will have cruel suffering, loss, injury of the body, heavy
  affliction, or loss of mind,

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 139

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Or a misfortune coming from the king, or a fearful accusation, or
  loss of relations, or destruction of treasures,

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 140

**[PALI]**

  destroyed, the fool will go to hell.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 141

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Not nakedness, not platted hair, not dirt, not fasting, or lying on
  the earth, not rubbing with dust, not sitting motionless, can purify a
  mortal who has not overcome desires.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 142

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who, though dressed in fine apparel, exercises tranquillity, is
  quiet, subdued, restrained, chaste, and has ceased to find fault with
  all other beings, he indeed is a Brahmana, an ascetic (sramana), a friar
  (bhikshu).

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 143

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Is there in this world any man so restrained by humility that he
  does not mind reproof, as a well-trained horse the whip?

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 144

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Like a well-trained horse when touched by the whip, be ye active
  and lively, and by faith, by virtue, by energy, by meditation, by
  discernment of the law you will overcome this great pain (of reproof),
  perfect in knowledge and in behaviour, and never forgetful.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 145

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like); fletchers bend the
  arrow; carpenters bend a log of wood; good people fashion themselves.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  ## 11. Old Age

### 146

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** How is there laughter, how is there joy, as this world is always
  burning? Why do you not seek a light, ye who are surrounded by darkness?

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 147

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Look at this dressed-up lump, covered with wounds, joined together,
  sickly, full of many thoughts, which has no strength, no hold!

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 148

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** This body is wasted, full of sickness, and frail; this heap of
  corruption breaks to pieces, life indeed ends in death.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 149

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Those white bones, like gourds thrown away in the autumn, what
  pleasure is there in looking at them?

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 150

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** After a stronghold has been made of the bones, it is covered with
  flesh and blood, and there dwell in it old age and death, pride and
  deceit.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 151

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The brilliant chariots of kings are destroyed, the body also
  approaches destruction, but the virtue of good people never approaches
  destruction,--thus do the good say to the good.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 152

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A man who has learnt little, grows old like an ox; his flesh grows,
  but his knowledge does not grow.

**153  154** Looking for the maker of this tabernacle, I shall have to run
  through a course of many births, so long as I do not find (him); and
  painful is birth again and again. But now, maker of the tabernacle, thou
  hast been seen; thou shalt not make up this tabernacle again. All thy
  rafters are broken, thy ridge-pole is sundered; the mind, approaching
  the Eternal (visankhara, nirvana), has attained to the extinction of all
  desires.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 155

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Men who have not observed proper discipline, and have not gained
  treasure in their youth, perish like old herons in a lake without fish.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 156

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Men who have not observed proper discipline, and have not gained
  treasure in their youth, lie, like broken bows, sighing after the past.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  ## 12. Self

### 157

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man hold himself dear, let him watch himself carefully; during
  one at least out of the three watches a wise man should be watchful.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 158

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let each man direct himself first to what is proper, then let him
  teach others; thus a wise man will not suffer.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 159

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man make himself as he teaches others to be, then, being
  himself well subdued, he may subdue (others); one's own self is indeed
  difficult to subdue.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 160

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Self is the lord of self, who else could be the lord? With self
  well subdued, a man finds a lord such as few can find.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 161

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The evil done by oneself, self-begotten, self-bred, crushes the
  foolish, as a diamond breaks a precious stone.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 162

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He whose wickedness is very great brings himself down to that state
  where his enemy wishes him to be, as a creeper does with the tree which
  it surrounds.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 163

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Bad deeds, and deeds hurtful to ourselves, are easy to do; what is
  beneficial and good, that is very difficult to do.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 164

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The foolish man who scorns the rule of the venerable (Arahat), of
  the elect (Ariya), of the virtuous, and follows false doctrine, he bears
  fruit to his own destruction, like the fruits of the Katthaka reed.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 165

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** By oneself the evil is done, by oneself one suffers; by oneself
  evil is left undone, by oneself one is purified. Purity and impurity
  belong to oneself, no one can purify another.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 166

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let no one forget his own duty for the sake of another's, however
  great; let a man, after he has discerned his own duty, be always
  attentive to his duty.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  ## 13. The World

  virtuous rests in bliss in this world and in the next.

**[TIN]**

  rests in bliss in this world and in the next.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 170

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Look upon the world as a bubble, look upon it as a mirage: the king
  of death does not see him who thus looks down upon the world.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 171

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Come, look at this glittering world, like unto a royal chariot; the
  foolish are immersed in it, but the wise do not touch it.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 172

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who formerly was reckless and afterwards became sober, brightens
  up this world, like the moon when freed from clouds.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 173

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He whose evil deeds are covered by good deeds, brightens up this
  world, like the moon when freed from clouds.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  like birds escaped from the net.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 175

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The swans go on the path of the sun, they go through the ether by
  means of their miraculous power; the wise are led out of this world,
  when they have conquered Mara and his train.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 176

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man has transgressed one law, and speaks lies, and scoffs at
  another world, there is no evil he will not do.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 177

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The uncharitable do not go to the world of the gods; fools only do
  not praise liberality; a wise man rejoices in liberality, and through it
  becomes blessed in the other world.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 178

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Better than sovereignty over the earth, better than going to
  heaven, better than lordship over all worlds, is the reward of the first
  step in holiness.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  ## 14. The Buddha (The Awakened)

### 179

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He whose conquest is not conquered again, into whose conquest no
  one in this world enters, by what track can you lead him, the Awakened,
  the Omniscient, the trackless?

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 180

  retirement (from the world).

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 182

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Difficult (to obtain) is the conception of men, difficult is the
  life of mortals, difficult is the hearing of the True Law, difficult is
  the birth of the Awakened (the attainment of Buddhahood).

  to groves and sacred trees.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 189

**[TIN]**

  born everywhere. Wherever such a sage is born, that race prospers.

  True Law, happy is peace in the church, happy is the devotion of those
  who are at peace.

  awakened (Buddha) or their disciples, those who have overcome the host

  measured by anybody.

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Therefore, one ought to follow the wise, the intelligent, the
  learned, the much enduring, the dutiful, the elect; one ought to follow

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  ## 16. Pleasure

### 209

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who gives himself to vanity, and does not give himself to
  meditation, forgetting the real aim (of life) and grasping at pleasure,
  will in time envy him who has exerted himself in meditation.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let no man ever look for what is pleasant, or what is unpleasant.
  Not to see what is pleasant is pain, and it is pain to see what is
  unpleasant.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 211

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let, therefore, no man love anything; loss of the beloved is evil.
  Those who love nothing and hate nothing, have no fetters.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 228

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a man who
  is always blamed, or a man who is always praised.

**229 230** But he whom those who discriminate praise continually day
  after day, as without blemish, wise, rich in knowledge and virtue, who
  would dare to blame him, like a coin made of gold from the Gambu river?
  Even the gods praise him, he is praised even by Brahman.

**[TIN]**

  body, and with thy body practise virtue!

**[TIN]**

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Thou art now like a sear leaf, the messengers of death (Yama) have

  hast no provision for thy journey.

**[TIN]**

**[MÜLLER]** Thy life has come to an end, thou art come near to death (Yama),

  provision for thy journey.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise! When thy impurities are
  blown away, and thou art free from guilt, thou wilt not enter again into
  birth and decay.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 239

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let a wise man blow off the impurities of his self, as a smith
  blows off the impurities of silver one by one, little by little, and
  from time to time.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 240

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As the impurity which springs from the iron, when it springs from
  it, destroys it; thus do a transgressor's own works lead him to the evil
  path.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 241

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The taint of prayers is non-repetition; the taint of houses,
  non-repair; the taint of the body is sloth; the taint of a watchman,
  thoughtlessness.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 242

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Bad conduct is the taint of woman, greediness the taint of a
  benefactor; tainted are all evil ways in this world and in the next.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 243

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** But there is a taint worse than all taints,--ignorance is
  the greatest taint. O mendicants! throw off that taint, and become
  taintless!

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 244

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Life is easy to live for a man who is without shame, a crow hero, a
  mischief-maker, an insulting, bold, and wretched fellow.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 245

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** But life is hard to live for a modest man, who always looks for
  what is pure, who is disinterested, quiet, spotless, and intelligent.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 246

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who destroys life, who speaks untruth, who in this world takes
  what is not given him, who goes to another man's wife;

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 247

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** And the man who gives himself to drinking intoxicating liquors, he,
  even in this world, digs up his own root.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 248

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** O man, know this, that the unrestrained are in a bad state; take
  care that greediness and vice do not bring thee to grief for a long
  time!

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 249

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The world gives according to their faith or according to their
  pleasure: if a man frets about the food and the drink given to others,
  he will find no rest either by day or by night.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 250

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He in whom that feeling is destroyed, and taken out with the very
  root, finds rest by day and by night.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  is no snare like folly, there is no torrent like greed.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 252

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The fault of others is easily perceived, but that of oneself is
  difficult to perceive; a man winnows his neighbour's faults like chaff,
  but his own fault he hides, as a cheat hides the bad die from the
  gambler.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 253

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man looks after the faults of others, and is always inclined
  to be offended, his own passions will grow, and he is far from the
  destruction of passions.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 254

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** There is no path through the air, a man is not a Samana by outward
  acts. The world delights in vanity, the Tathagatas (the Buddhas) are
  free from vanity.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 255

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** There is no path through the air, a man is not a Samana by outward

  shaken.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  ## 19. The Just

**256 257** A man is not just if he carries a matter by violence; no, he
  who distinguishes both right and wrong, who is learned and leads others,
  not by violence, but by law and equity, and who is guarded by the law
  and intelligent, he is called just.

### 258

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A man is not learned because he talks much; he who is patient, free
  from hatred and fear, he is called learned.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 259

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A man is not a supporter of the law because he talks much; even if
  a man has learnt little, but sees the law bodily, he is a supporter of
  the law, a man who never neglects the law.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 260

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A man is not an elder because his head is grey; his age may be
  ripe, but he is called `Old-in-vain.'

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 261

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He in whom there is truth, virtue, love, restraint, moderation, he
  who is free from impurity and is wise, he is called an elder.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 262

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** An envious greedy, dishonest man does not become respectable by
  means of much talking only, or by the beauty of his complexion.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 263

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He in whom all this is destroyed, and taken out with the very root,
  he, when freed from hatred and wise, is called respectable.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 264

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Not by tonsure does an undisciplined man who speaks falsehood
  become a Samana; can a man be a Samana who is still held captive by
  desire and greediness?

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 265

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who always quiets the evil, whether small or large, he is called
  a Samana (a quiet man), because he has quieted all evil.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 266

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A man is not a mendicant (Bhikshu) simply because he asks others
  for alms; he who adopts the whole law is a Bhikshu, not he who only
  begs.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 267

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who is above good and evil, who is chaste, who with knowledge
  passes through the world, he indeed is called a Bhikshu.

**268 269** A man is not a Muni because he observes silence (mona, i.e.
  mauna), if he is foolish and ignorant; but the wise who, taking the
  balance, chooses the good and avoids evil, he is a Muni, and is a Muni
  thereby; he who in this world weighs both sides is called a Muni.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 270

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A man is not an elect (Ariya) because he injures living creatures;
  because he has pity on all living creatures, therefore is a man called
  Ariya.

**271 272** Not only by discipline and vows, not only by much learning,
  not by entering into a trance, not by sleeping alone, do I earn the
  happiness of release which no worldling can know. Bhikshu, be not
  confident as long as thou hast not attained the extinction of desires.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  ## 20. The Way

### 273

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The best of ways is the eightfold; the best of truths the four
  words; the best of virtues passionlessness; the best of men he who has
  eyes to see.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 274

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** This is the way, there is no other that leads to the purifying of
  intelligence. Go on this way! Everything else is the deceit of Mara (the
  tempter).

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 275

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If you go on this way, you will make an end of pain! The way was
  preached by me, when I had understood the removal of the thorns (in the
  flesh).

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 276

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** You yourself must make an effort. The Tathagatas (Buddhas) are only
  preachers. The thoughtful who enter the way are freed from the bondage
  of Mara.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 277

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** `All created things perish,' he who knows and sees this becomes
  passive in pain; this is the way to purity.

  becomes passive in pain; this is the way that leads to purity.

**[TIN]**

  in pain; this is the way that leads to purity.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 280

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who does not rouse himself when it is time to rise, who, though
  young and strong, is full of sloth, whose will and thought are weak,
  that lazy and idle man will never find the way to knowledge.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 281

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Watching his speech, well restrained in mind, let a man never
  commit any wrong with his body! Let a man but keep these three roads of
  action clear, and he will achieve the way which is taught by the wise.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 282

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Through zeal knowledge is gotten, through lack of zeal knowledge is
  lost; let a man who knows this double path of gain and loss thus place
  himself that knowledge may grow.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 283

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Cut down the whole forest (of lust), not a tree only! Danger comes
  out of the forest (of lust). When you have cut down both the forest (of
  lust) and its undergrowth, then, Bhikshus, you will be rid of the forest
  and free!

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 284

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** So long as the love of man towards women, even the smallest, is not
  destroyed, so long is his mind in bondage, as the calf that drinks milk
  is to its mother.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Cut out the love of self, like an autumn lotus, with thy hand!

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 286

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** `Here I shall dwell in the rain, here in winter and summer,' thus
  the fool meditates, and does not think of his death.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 287

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Death comes and carries off that man, praised for his children and
  flocks, his mind distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 288

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Sons are no help, nor a father, nor relations; there is no help
  from kinsfolk for one whom death has seized.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 289

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A wise and good man who knows the meaning of this, should quickly
  clear the way that leads to Nirvana.

  hatred.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 292

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** What ought to be done is neglected, what ought not to be done is
  done; the desires of unruly, thoughtless people are always increasing.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 293

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** But they whose whole watchfulness is always directed to their body,
  who do not follow what ought not to be done, and who steadfastly do what
  ought to be done, the desires of such watchful and wise people will come
  to an end.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  and night always delights in meditation.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 302

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** It is hard to leave the world (to become a friar), it is hard to
  enjoy the world; hard is the monastery, painful are the houses; painful
  it is to dwell with equals (to share everything in common) and the
  itinerant mendicant is beset with pain. Therefore let no man be an
  itinerant mendicant and he will not be beset with pain.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 303

**[PALI]**

  ## 22. The Downward Course

### 306

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who says what is not, goes to hell; he also who, having done a
  thing, says I have not done it. After death both are equal, they are men
  with evil deeds in the next world.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 307

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Many men whose shoulders are covered with the yellow gown are
  ill-conditioned and unrestrained; such evil-doers by their evil deeds go
  to hell.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 308

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Better it would be to swallow a heated iron ball, like flaring
  fire, than that a bad unrestrained fellow should live on the charity of
  the land.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 309

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Four things does a wreckless man gain who covets his neighbour's
  wife,--a bad reputation, an uncomfortable bed, thirdly, punishment, and
  lastly, hell.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 310

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** There is bad reputation, and the evil way (to hell), there is the
  short pleasure of the frightened in the arms of the frightened, and
  the king imposes heavy punishment; therefore let no man think of his
  neighbour's wife.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 311

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As a grass-blade, if badly grasped, cuts the arm, badly-practised
  asceticism leads to hell.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 312

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** An act carelessly performed, a broken vow, and hesitating obedience
  to discipline, all this brings no great reward.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 313

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If anything is to be done, let a man do it, let him attack it
  vigorously! A careless pilgrim only scatters the dust of his passions
  more widely.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 314

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** An evil deed is better left undone, for a man repents of it
  afterwards; a good deed is better done, for having done it, one does not
  repent.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 315

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Like a well-guarded frontier fort, with defences within and
  without, so let a man guard himself. Not a moment should escape, for
  they who allow the right moment to pass, suffer pain when they are in
  hell.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 316

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** They who are ashamed of what they ought not to be ashamed of, and
  are not ashamed of what they ought to be ashamed of, such men, embracing
  false doctrines enter the evil path.

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** They who fear when they ought not to fear, and fear not when they
  ought to fear, such men, embracing false doctrines, enter the evil path.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 318

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** They who forbid when there is nothing to be forbidden, and forbid
  not when there is something to be forbidden, such men, embracing false
  doctrines, enter the evil path.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 319

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** They who know what is forbidden as forbidden, and what is not
  forbidden as not forbidden, such men, embracing the true doctrine, enter
  the good path.

  ## 23. The Elephant

### 320

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Silently shall I endure abuse as the elephant in battle endures the
  arrow sent from the bow: for the world is ill-natured.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 321

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** They lead a tamed elephant to battle, the king mounts a tamed
  elephant; the tamed is the best among men, he who silently endures
  abuse.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 322

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Mules are good, if tamed, and noble Sindhu horses, and elephants
  with large tusks; but he who tames himself is better still.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 323

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** For with these animals does no man reach the untrodden country
  (Nirvana), where a tamed man goes on a tamed animal, viz. on his own
  well-tamed self.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 324

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The elephant called Dhanapalaka, his temples running with sap, and
  difficult to hold, does not eat a morsel when bound; the elephant longs
  for the elephant grove.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 325

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man becomes fat and a great eater, if he is sleepy and rolls
  himself about, that fool, like a hog fed on wash, is born again and
  again.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 326

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** This mind of mine went formerly wandering about as it liked, as
  it listed, as it pleased; but I shall now hold it in thoroughly, as the
  rider who holds the hook holds in the furious elephant.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 327

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Be not thoughtless, watch your thoughts! Draw yourself out of the
  evil way, like an elephant sunk in mud.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 328

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man find a prudent companion who walks with him, is wise, and
  lives soberly, he may walk with him, overcoming all dangers, happy, but
  considerate.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 329

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man find no prudent companion who walks with him, is wise,
  and lives soberly, let him walk alone, like a king who has left his
  conquered country behind,--like an elephant in the forest.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 330

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** It is better to live alone, there is no companionship with a fool;
  let a man walk alone, let him commit no sin, with few wishes, like an
  elephant in the forest.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 331

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If an occasion arises, friends are pleasant; enjoyment is pleasant,
  whatever be the cause; a good work is pleasant in the hour of death; the
  giving up of all grief is pleasant.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 332

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Pleasant in the world is the state of a mother, pleasant the state
  of a father, pleasant the state of a Samana, pleasant the state of a
  Brahmana.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 333

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Pleasant is virtue lasting to old age, pleasant is a faith firmly
  rooted; pleasant is attainment of intelligence, pleasant is avoiding of
  sins.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  ## 24. Thirst

  world, his sufferings increase like the abounding Birana grass.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 336

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who overcomes this fierce thirst, difficult to be conquered in
  this world, sufferings fall off from him, like water-drops from a lotus
  leaf.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 337

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** This salutary word I tell you, `Do ye, as many as are here
  assembled, dig up the root of thirst, as he who wants the sweet-scented
  Usira root must dig up the Birana grass, that Mara (the tempter) may not
  crush you again and again, as the stream crushes the reeds.'

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 338

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As a tree, even though it has been cut down, is firm so long as its
  root is safe, and grows again, thus, unless the feeders of thirst are
  destroyed, the pain (of life) will return again and again.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 339

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He whose thirst running towards pleasure is exceeding strong in the
  thirty-six channels, the waves will carry away that misguided man, viz.
  his desires which are set on passion.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 340

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The channels run everywhere, the creeper (of passion) stands
  sprouting; if you see the creeper springing up, cut its root by means of
  knowledge.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 341

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A creature's pleasures are extravagant and luxurious; sunk in lust
  and looking for pleasure, men undergo (again and again) birth and decay.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 342

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Men, driven on by thirst, run about like a snared hare; held in
  fetters and bonds, they undergo pain for a long time, again and again.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 343

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Men, driven on by thirst, run about like a snared hare;
  let therefore the mendicant drive out thirst, by striving after
  passionlessness for himself.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 344

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who having got rid of the forest (of lust) (i.e. after having
  reached Nirvana) gives himself over to forest-life (i.e. to lust), and
  who, when removed from the forest (i.e. from lust), runs to the forest
  (i.e. to lust), look at that man! though free, he runs into bondage.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 345

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Wise people do not call that a strong fetter which is made of iron,
  wood, or hemp; far stronger is the care for precious stones and rings,
  for sons and a wife.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 346

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** That fetter wise people call strong which drags down, yields, but
  is difficult to undo; after having cut this at last, people leave the
  world, free from cares, and leaving desires and pleasures behind.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 347

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Those who are slaves to passions, run down with the stream (of
  desires), as a spider runs down the web which he has made himself;
  when they have cut this, at last, wise people leave the world free from
  cares, leaving all affection behind.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 348

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Give up what is before, give up what is behind, give up what is in
  the middle, when thou goest to the other shore of existence; if thy mind
  is altogether free, thou wilt not again enter into birth and decay.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 349

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man is tossed about by doubts, full of strong passions, and
  yearning only for what is delightful, his thirst will grow more and
  more, and he will indeed make his fetters strong.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 350

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man delights in quieting doubts, and, always reflecting,
  dwells on what is not delightful (the impurity of the body, &c.), he
  certainly will remove, nay, he will cut the fetter of Mara.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who is without thirst and without affection, who understands the

**[THANISSARO]**

### 353

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** `I have conquered all, I know all, in all conditions of life I am
  free from taint; I have left all, and through the destruction of thirst
  I am free; having learnt myself, whom shall I teach?'

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 354

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The gift of the law exceeds all gifts; the sweetness of the law
  exceeds all sweetness; the delight in the law exceeds all delights; the
  extinction of thirst overcomes all pain.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 355

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Pleasures destroy the foolish, if they look not for the other
  shore; the foolish by his thirst for pleasures destroys himself, as if
  he were his own enemy.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 356

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by passion:
  therefore a gift bestowed on the passionless brings great reward.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 357

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by hatred:
  therefore a gift bestowed on those who do not hate brings great reward.

**[TIN]**

  ## 25. The Bhikshu (Mendicant)

**[MÜLLER]** Restraint in the eye is good, good is restraint in the ear, in the
  nose restraint is good, good is restraint in the tongue.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 361

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** In the body restraint is good, good is restraint in speech, in
  thought restraint is good, good is restraint in all things. A Bhikshu

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who controls his hand, he who controls his feet, he who controls

  collected, who is solitary and content, him they call Bhikshu.

  law.

**[TIN]**

  cut off passion and hatred thou wilt go to Nirvana.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 370

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Cut off the five (senses), leave the five, rise above the five. A
  Bhikshu, who has escaped from the five fetters, he is called Oghatinna,
  `saved from the flood.'

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 371

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Meditate, O Bhikshu, and be not heedless! Do not direct thy thought
  to what gives pleasure that thou mayest not for thy heedlessness have to
  swallow the iron ball (in hell), and that thou mayest not cry out when
  burning, `This is pain.'

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 372

**[PALI]**

  elements (khandha) of the body, he finds happiness and joy which belong
  to those who know the immortal (Nirvana).

**[TIN]**

### 375

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** And this is the beginning here for a wise Bhikshu: watchfulness

  Buddha, brightens up this world, like the moon when free from clouds.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

  ## 26. The Brahmana (Arhat)

### 383

**[PALI]**

  When you have understood the destruction of all that was made, you will
  understand that which was not made.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 384

**[PALI]**

  knowledge.

**[MÜLLER]** The sun is bright by day, the moon shines by night, the warrior
  is bright in his armour, the Brahmana is bright in his meditation; but
  Buddha, the Awakened, is bright with splendour day and night.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 388

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Because a man is rid of evil, therefore he is called Brahmana;
  because he walks quietly, therefore he is called Samana; because he
  has sent away his own impurities, therefore he is called Pravragita
  (Pabbagita, a pilgrim).

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 389

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** No one should attack a Brahmana, but no Brahmana (if attacked)
  should let himself fly at his aggressor! Woe to him who strikes a
  Brahmana, more woe to him who flies at his aggressor!

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 390

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** It advantages a Brahmana not a little if he holds his mind back

**[MÜLLER]** Him I call indeed a Brahmana who does not offend by body, word, or

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 393

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A man does not become a Brahmana by his platted hair, by his
  family, or by birth; in whom there is truth and righteousness, he is
  blessed, he is a Brahmana.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 394

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** What is the use of platted hair, O fool! what of the raiment of
  goat-skins? Within thee there is ravening, but the outside thou makest
  clean.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 395

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The man who wears dirty raiments, who is emaciated and covered with
  veins, who lives alone in the forest, and meditates, him I call indeed a
  Brahmana.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**

### 396

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** I do not call a man a Brahmana because of his origin or of his
  mother. He is indeed arrogant, and he is wealthy: but the poor, who is
  free from all attachments, him I call indeed a Brahmana.

**[TIN]**

  body.

**[TIN]**

**[MÜLLER]** Him I call indeed a Brahmana who does not cling to pleasures, like
  water on a lotus leaf, like a mustard seed on the point of a needle.

**[TIN]**

**[THANISSARO]**
