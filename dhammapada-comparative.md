# The Dhammapada - Comparison of Pali to English Translations

This document is part of my notes used in creating a new, gender neutral, plain language version of the Dhammapada. The starting point for my project is the 19th century translation by F. Max Müller which is available on Project Gutenberg, but my intention is to incorporate thinking from other translators as well, rather than rely on Müller's assumptions.

Here I am contrasting the Müller version with more recent translations by Buddhist scholars who have gone back to the original Pali and have different interpretations of many words as well as dramatically different approaches to structuring the verses in English.

Please consider the use of the non-Müller versions here as fair use. Included for their value in interpreting the text via comparison and in the spirit of their status as gifts of dhamma.

### 1 Cakkhupalatthera Vatthu

**[PALI]**
Manopubbangama dhamma //
manosettha manomaya //
manasa ce padutthena //
bhasati va karoti va //
tato nam dukkhamanveti //
cakkamva vahato padam.

**[MÜLLER]** All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the carriage.

**[TIN]** All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind as their chief; they are mind-made. If one speaks or acts with an evil mind, 'dukkha' follows him just as the wheel follows the hoofprint of the ox that draws the cart.

**[BHIKKU]** Phenomena are   preceded by the heart, //
	ruled by the heart, //
	made of the heart. //
If you speak or act //
with a corrupted heart, /
then suffering follows you — //
as the wheel of the cart,//
	the track of the ox //
	that pulls it.

### 2 Matthakundali Vatthu

**[PALI]** Manopubbangama dhamma //
manosettha manomaya //
manasa ce pasannena //
bhasati va karoti va //
tato nam sukha manveti //
chayava anapayini.

**[MÜLLER]** All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded
  on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts
  with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never
  leaves him.

**[TIN]** All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind as their chief; they are mind-made. If one speaks or acts with a pure mind, happiness (sukha) follows him like a shadow that never leaves him.

**[BHIKKU]** Phenomena are  preceded by the heart, //
	ruled by the heart, //
	made of the heart. //
If you speak or act //
with a calm, bright heart, //
then happiness follows you, //
like a shadow //
	that never leaves.


### 3

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** "He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,"--in those
  who harbour such thoughts hatred will never cease.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 4

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** "He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,"--in those
  who do not harbour such thoughts hatred will cease.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 5

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** For hatred does not cease by hatred at any time: hatred ceases by
  love, this is an old rule.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 6

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The world does not know that we must all come to an end here;--but
  those who know it, their quarrels cease at once.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 7

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who lives looking for pleasures only, his senses uncontrolled,
  immoderate in his food, idle, and weak, Mara (the tempter) will
  certainly overthrow him, as the wind throws down a weak tree.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 8

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who lives without looking for pleasures, his senses well
  controlled, moderate in his food, faithful and strong, him Mara will
  certainly not overthrow, any more than the wind throws down a rocky
  mountain.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 9

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who wishes to put on the yellow dress without having cleansed
  himself from sin, who disregards temperance and truth, is unworthy of
  the yellow dress.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 10

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** But he who has cleansed himself from sin, is well grounded in all
  virtues, and regards also temperance and truth, he is indeed worthy of
  the yellow dress.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 11

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** They who imagine truth in untruth, and see untruth in truth, never
  arrive at truth, but follow vain desires.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 12

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** They who know truth in truth, and untruth in untruth, arrive at
  truth, and follow true desires.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 13

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As rain breaks through an ill-thatched house, passion will break
  through an unreflecting mind.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 14

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As rain does not break through a well-thatched house, passion will
  not break through a well-reflecting mind.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 15

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The evil-doer mourns in this world, and he mourns in the next; he
  mourns in both. He mourns and suffers when he sees the evil of his own
  work.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 16

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The virtuous man delights in this world, and he delights in the
  next; he delights in both. He delights and rejoices, when he sees the
  purity of his own work.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 17

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The evil-doer suffers in this world, and he suffers in the next; he
  suffers in both. He suffers when he thinks of the evil he has done; he
  suffers more when going on the evil path.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 18

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The virtuous man is happy in this world, and he is happy in the
  next; he is happy in both. He is happy when he thinks of the good he has
  done; he is still more happy when going on the good path.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 19

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The thoughtless man, even if he can recite a large portion (of the
  law), but is not a doer of it, has no share in the priesthood, but is
  like a cowherd counting the cows of others.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

  ## 20

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The follower of the law, even if he can recite only a small portion
  (of the law), but, having forsaken passion and hatred and foolishness,
  possesses true knowledge and serenity of mind, he, caring for nothing in
  this world or that to come, has indeed a share in the priesthood.

  ## 2. On Earnestness

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

  ## 21

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Earnestness is the path of immortality (Nirvana), thoughtlessness
  the path of death. Those who are in earnest do not die, those who are
  thoughtless are as if dead already.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 22

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Those who are advanced in earnestness, having understood this
  clearly, delight in earnestness, and rejoice in the knowledge of the
  Ariyas (the elect).

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 23

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** These wise people, meditative, steady, always possessed of strong
  powers, attain to Nirvana, the highest happiness.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 24

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If an earnest person has roused himself, if he is not forgetful,
  if his deeds are pure, if he acts with consideration, if he restrains
  himself, and lives according to law,--then his glory will increase.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 25

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** By rousing himself, by earnestness, by restraint and control, the
  wise man may make for himself an island which no flood can overwhelm.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 26

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Fools follow after vanity, men of evil wisdom. The wise man keeps
  earnestness as his best jewel.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 27

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Follow not after vanity, nor after the enjoyment of love and lust!
  He who is earnest and meditative, obtains ample joy.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 28

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** When the learned man drives away vanity by earnestness, he, the
  wise, climbing the terraced heights of wisdom, looks down upon the
  fools, serene he looks upon the toiling crowd, as one that stands on a
  mountain looks down upon them that stand upon the plain.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 29

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Earnest among the thoughtless, awake among the sleepers, the wise
  man advances like a racer, leaving behind the hack.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 30

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** By earnestness did Maghavan (Indra) rise to the lordship of the
  gods. People praise earnestness; thoughtlessness is always blamed.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 31

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in earnestness, who looks with
  fear on thoughtlessness, moves about like fire, burning all his fetters,
  small or large.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 32

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in reflection, who looks with
  fear on thoughtlessness, cannot fall away (from his perfect state)--he
  is close upon Nirvana.

  ## 3. Thought

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 33

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As a fletcher makes straight his arrow, a wise man makes straight
  his trembling and unsteady thought, which is difficult to guard,
  difficult to hold back.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 34

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As a fish taken from his watery home and thrown on dry ground, our
  thought trembles all over in order to escape the dominion of Mara (the
  tempter).

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 35

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** It is good to tame the mind, which is difficult to hold in and
  flighty, rushing wherever it listeth; a tamed mind brings happiness.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 36

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let the wise man guard his thoughts, for they are difficult to
  perceive, very artful, and they rush wherever they list: thoughts well
  guarded bring happiness.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 37

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Those who bridle their mind which travels far, moves about alone,
  is without a body, and hides in the chamber (of the heart), will be free
  from the bonds of Mara (the tempter).

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 38

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man's thoughts are unsteady, if he does not know the true law,
  if his peace of mind is troubled, his knowledge will never be perfect.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 39

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man's thoughts are not dissipated, if his mind is not
  perplexed, if he has ceased to think of good or evil, then there is no
  fear for him while he is watchful.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 40

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Knowing that this body is (fragile) like a jar, and making this
  thought firm like a fortress, one should attack Mara (the tempter) with
  the weapon of knowledge, one should watch him when conquered, and should
  never rest.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 41

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Before long, alas! this body will lie on the earth, despised,
  without understanding, like a useless log.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 42

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Whatever a hater may do to a hater, or an enemy to an enemy, a
  wrongly-directed mind will do us greater mischief.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 43

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Not a mother, not a father will do so much, nor any other relative;
  a well-directed mind will do us greater service.

  ## 4. Flowers

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 44

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Who shall overcome this earth, and the world of Yama (the lord of
  the departed), and the world of the gods? Who shall find out the plainly
  shown path of virtue, as a clever man finds out the (right) flower?

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 45

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The disciple will overcome the earth, and the world of Yama, and the
  world of the gods. The disciple will find out the plainly shown path of
  virtue, as a clever man finds out the (right) flower.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 46

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who knows that this body is like froth, and has learnt that it
  is as unsubstantial as a mirage, will break the flower-pointed arrow of
  Mara, and never see the king of death.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 47

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Death carries off a man who is gathering flowers and whose mind is
  distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 48

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Death subdues a man who is gathering flowers, and whose mind is
  distracted, before he is satiated in his pleasures.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 49

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As the bee collects nectar and departs without injuring the flower,
  or its colour or scent, so let a sage dwell in his village.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 50

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Not the perversities of others, not their sins of commission or
  omission, but his own misdeeds and negligences should a sage take notice
  of.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 51

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Like a beautiful flower, full of colour, but without scent, are the
  fine but fruitless words of him who does not act accordingly.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 52

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** But, like a beautiful flower, full of colour and full of scent, are
  the fine and fruitful words of him who acts accordingly.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 53

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As many kinds of wreaths can be made from a heap of flowers, so many
  good things may be achieved by a mortal when once he is born.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 54

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The scent of flowers does not travel against the wind, nor (that
  of) sandal-wood, or of Tagara and Mallika flowers; but the odour of good
  people travels even against the wind; a good man pervades every place.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 55

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Sandal-wood or Tagara, a lotus-flower, or a Vassiki, among these
  sorts of perfumes, the perfume of virtue is unsurpassed.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 56

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Mean is the scent that comes from Tagara and sandal-wood;--the
  perfume of those who possess virtue rises up to the gods as the highest.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 57

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Of the people who possess these virtues, who live without
  thoughtlessness, and who are emancipated through true knowledge, Mara,
  the tempter, never finds the way.

**58 59** As on a heap of rubbish cast upon the highway the lily will
  grow full of sweet perfume and delight, thus the disciple of the truly
  enlightened Buddha shines forth by his knowledge among those who are
  like rubbish, among the people that walk in darkness.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

  ## 5. The Fool


### 60

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Long is the night to him who is awake; long is a mile to him who is
  tired; long is life to the foolish who do not know the true law.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 61

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a traveller does not meet with one who is his better, or
  his equal, let him firmly keep to his solitary journey; there is no
  companionship with a fool.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 62

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** "These sons belong to me, and this wealth belongs to me," with such
  thoughts a fool is tormented. He himself does not belong to himself; how
  much less sons and wealth?

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 63

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The fool who knows his foolishness, is wise at least so far. But a
  fool who thinks himself wise, he is called a fool indeed.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 64

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a fool be associated with a wise man even all his life, he will
  perceive the truth as little as a spoon perceives the taste of soup.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 65

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If an intelligent man be associated for one minute only with a wise
  man, he will soon perceive the truth, as the tongue perceives the taste
  of soup.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 66

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Fools of little understanding have themselves for their greatest
  enemies, for they do evil deeds which must bear bitter fruits.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 67

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** That deed is not well done of which a man must repent, and the
  reward of which he receives crying and with a tearful face.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 68

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** No, that deed is well done of which a man does not repent, and the
  reward of which he receives gladly and cheerfully.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 69

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As long as the evil deed done does not bear fruit, the fool thinks
  it is like honey; but when it ripens, then the fool suffers grief.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 70

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let a fool month after month eat his food (like an ascetic) with the
  tip of a blade of Kusa grass, yet he is not worth the sixteenth particle
  of those who have well weighed the law.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 71

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** An evil deed, like newly-drawn milk, does not turn (suddenly);
  smouldering, like fire covered by ashes, it follows the fool.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 72

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** And when the evil deed, after it has become known, brings sorrow to
  the fool, then it destroys his bright lot, nay, it cleaves his head.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 73

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let the fool wish for a false reputation, for precedence among the
  Bhikshus, for lordship in the convents, for worship among other people!

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 74

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** "May both the layman and he who has left the world think that this
  is done by me; may they be subject to me in everything which is to be
  done or is not to be done," thus is the mind of the fool, and his desire
  and pride increase.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 75

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** "One is the road that leads to wealth, another the road that leads
  to Nirvana;" if the Bhikshu, the disciple of Buddha, has learnt this,
  he will not yearn for honour, he will strive after separation from the
  world.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

  ## 6. The Wise Man (Pandita)

### 76

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If you see an intelligent man who tells you where true treasures are
  to be found, who shows what is to be avoided, and administers reproofs,
  follow that wise man; it will be better, not worse, for those who follow
  him.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 77

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let him admonish, let him teach, let him forbid what is
  improper!--he will be beloved of the good, by the bad he will be hated.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 78

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Do not have evil-doers for friends, do not have low people for
  friends: have virtuous people for friends, have for friends the best of
  men.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 79

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who drinks in the law lives happily with a serene mind: the sage
  rejoices always in the law, as preached by the elect (Ariyas).

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 80

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like); fletchers bend the
  arrow; carpenters bend a log of wood; wise people fashion themselves.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 81

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind, wise people falter not
  amidst blame and praise.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 82

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Wise people, after they have listened to the laws, become serene,
  like a deep, smooth, and still lake.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 83

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Good people walk on whatever befall, the good do not prattle,
  longing for pleasure; whether touched by happiness or sorrow wise people
  never appear elated or depressed.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 84

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If, whether for his own sake, or for the sake of others, a man
  wishes neither for a son, nor for wealth, nor for lordship, and if he
  does not wish for his own success by unfair means, then he is good,
  wise, and virtuous.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 85

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Few are there among men who arrive at the other shore (become
  Arhats); the other people here run up and down the shore.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 86

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** But those who, when the law has been well preached to them, follow
  the law, will pass across the dominion of death, however difficult to
  overcome.

**87 88** A wise man should leave the dark state (of ordinary life), and
  follow the bright state (of the Bhikshu). After going from his home to
  a homeless state, he should in his retirement look for enjoyment where
  there seemed to be no enjoyment. Leaving all pleasures behind, and
  calling nothing his own, the wise man should purge himself from all the
  troubles of the mind.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 89

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Those whose mind is well grounded in the (seven) elements of
  knowledge, who without clinging to anything, rejoice in freedom from
  attachment, whose appetites have been conquered, and who are full of
  light, are free (even) in this world.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

  ## 7. The Venerable (Arhat).

### 90

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** There is no suffering for him who has finished his journey, and
  abandoned grief, who has freed himself on all sides, and thrown off all
  fetters.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 91

**[MÜLLER]** If one man conquer in battle a thousand times thousand men, and if
  another conquer himself, he is the greatest of conquerors.

**104 105** One's own self conquered is better than all other people; not

  the victory of a man who has vanquished himself, and always lives under
  restraint.

### 106

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Whatever a man sacrifice in this world as an offering or as an
  oblation for a whole year in order to gain merit, the whole of it is

  will increase to him, viz. life, beauty, happiness, power.

  life of one day is better if a man sees the highest law.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

  ## 9. Evil

### 116

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man would hasten towards the good, he should keep his thought
  away from evil; if a man does what is good slothfully, his mind delights
  in evil.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 117

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man commits a sin, let him not do it again; let him not

  happy days.

**[TIN]**

### 121

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let no man think lightly of evil, saying in his heart, It will not
  come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is
  filled; the fool becomes full of evil, even if he gather it little by
  little.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 122

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let no man think lightly of good, saying in his heart, It will not
  come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is
  filled; the wise man becomes full of good, even if he gather it little
  by little.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 123

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let a man avoid evil deeds, as a merchant, if he has few companions
  and carries much wealth, avoids a dangerous road; as a man who loves
  life avoids poison.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 124

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who has no wound on his hand, may touch poison with his hand;

**[TIN]**

  will touch thee.

**[TIN]**

**[MÜLLER]** If, like a shattered metal plate (gong), thou utter not, then thou
  hast reached Nirvana; contention is not known to thee.

  come to one of these ten states:

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who, though dressed in fine apparel, exercises tranquillity, is
  quiet, subdued, restrained, chaste, and has ceased to find fault with

  and lively, and by faith, by virtue, by energy, by meditation, by
  discernment of the law you will overcome this great pain (of reproof),
  perfect in knowledge and in behaviour, and never forgetful.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 145

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like); fletchers bend the

  ## 11. Old Age

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** How is there laughter, how is there joy, as this world is always
  burning? Why do you not seek a light, ye who are surrounded by darkness?

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 147

**[MÜLLER]** Look at this dressed-up lump, covered with wounds, joined together,
  sickly, full of many thoughts, which has no strength, no hold!

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 148

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** This body is wasted, full of sickness, and frail; this heap of
  corruption breaks to pieces, life indeed ends in death.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 149

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Those white bones, like gourds thrown away in the autumn, what
  pleasure is there in looking at them?

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 150

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** After a stronghold has been made of the bones, it is covered with
  flesh and blood, and there dwell in it old age and death, pride and
  deceit.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 151

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The brilliant chariots of kings are destroyed, the body also
  approaches destruction, but the virtue of good people never approaches
  destruction,--thus do the good say to the good.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 152

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A man who has learnt little, grows old like an ox; his flesh grows,
  but his knowledge does not grow.

**153  154** Looking for the maker of this tabernacle, I shall have to run
  through a course of many births, so long as I do not find (him); and
  painful is birth again and again. But now, maker of the tabernacle, thou
  hast been seen; thou shalt not make up this tabernacle again. All thy
  rafters are broken, thy ridge-pole is sundered; the mind, approaching
  the Eternal (visankhara, nirvana), has attained to the extinction of all
  desires.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 155

**[MÜLLER]** Men who have not observed proper discipline, and have not gained

  treasure in their youth, lie, like broken bows, sighing after the past.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

  ## 12. Self

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man hold himself dear, let him watch himself carefully; during
  one at least out of the three watches a wise man should be watchful.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 158

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let each man direct himself first to what is proper, then let him
  teach others; thus a wise man will not suffer.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 159

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man make himself as he teaches others to be, then, being
  himself well subdued, he may subdue (others); one's own self is indeed
  difficult to subdue.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 160

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Self is the lord of self, who else could be the lord? With self

  foolish, as a diamond breaks a precious stone.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

  it surrounds.

**[TIN]**

  beneficial and good, that is very difficult to do.

**[BHIKKU]**

### 164

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The foolish man who scorns the rule of the venerable (Arahat), of
  the elect (Ariya), of the virtuous, and follows false doctrine, he bears
  fruit to his own destruction, like the fruits of the Katthaka reed.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 165

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** By oneself the evil is done, by oneself one suffers; by oneself
  evil is left undone, by oneself one is purified. Purity and impurity
  belong to oneself, no one can purify another.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 166

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let no one forget his own duty for the sake of another's, however
  great; let a man, after he has discerned his own duty, be always
  attentive to his duty.

  rests in bliss in this world and in the next.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 170

  of death does not see him who thus looks down upon the world.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 171

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Come, look at this glittering world, like unto a royal chariot; the
  foolish are immersed in it, but the wise do not touch it.

**[TIN]**

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

  another world, there is no evil he will not do.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 177

  not praise liberality; a wise man rejoices in liberality, and through it
  becomes blessed in the other world.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Better than sovereignty over the earth, better than going to
  heaven, better than lordship over all worlds, is the reward of the first
  step in holiness.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

**[PALI]**

  retirement (from the world).

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 182

**[PALI]**

  life of mortals, difficult is the hearing of the True Law, difficult is
  the birth of the Awakened (the attainment of Buddhahood).

**[TIN]**

### 183

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Not to commit any sin, to do good, and to purify one's mind, that

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 184

**[PALI]**

  highest Nirvana; for he is not an anchorite (pravragita) who strikes
  others, he is not an ascetic (sramana) who insults others.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 185

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Not to blame, not to strike, to live restrained under the law,
  to be moderate in eating, to sleep and sit alone, and to dwell on the
  highest thoughts,--this is the teaching of the Awakened.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 186

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** There is no satisfying lusts, even by a shower of gold pieces; he
  who knows that lusts have a short taste and cause pain, he is wise;

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

  to groves and sacred trees.

**[TIN]**

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 193

**[PALI]**

  born everywhere. Wherever such a sage is born, that race prospers.

**[TIN]**

  True Law, happy is peace in the church, happy is the devotion of those

**[MÜLLER]** The sight of the elect (Arya) is good, to live with them is always
  happiness; if a man does not see fools, he will be truly happy.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 207

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who walks in the company of fools suffers a long way; company
  with fools, as with an enemy, is always painful; company with the wise
  is pleasure, like meeting with kinsfolk.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 208

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Therefore, one ought to follow the wise, the intelligent, the
  learned, the much enduring, the dutiful, the elect; one ought to follow
  a good and wise man, as the moon follows the path of the stars.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

  ## 16. Pleasure

### 209

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who gives himself to vanity, and does not give himself to
  meditation, forgetting the real aim (of life) and grasping at pleasure,
  will in time envy him who has exerted himself in meditation.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 210

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let no man ever look for what is pleasant, or what is unpleasant.
  Not to see what is pleasant is pain, and it is pain to see what is
  unpleasant.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 211

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let, therefore, no man love anything; loss of the beloved is evil.
  Those who love nothing and hate nothing, have no fetters.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 212

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** From pleasure comes grief, from pleasure comes fear; he who is free
  from pleasure knows neither grief nor fear.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 213

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** From affection comes grief, from affection comes fear; he who is
  free from affection knows neither grief nor fear.

  lust knows neither grief nor fear.

  love knows neither grief nor fear.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 216

**[MÜLLER]** From greed comes grief, from greed comes fear; he who is free from
  greed knows neither grief nor fear.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 217

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who possesses virtue and intelligence, who is just, speaks the
  truth, and does what is his own business, him the world will hold dear.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 218

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He in whom a desire for the Ineffable (Nirvana) has sprung up, who
  is satisfied in his mind, and whose thoughts are not bewildered by love,
  he is called urdhvamsrotas (carried upwards by the stream).

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 219

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Kinsmen, friends, and lovers salute a man who has been long away,
  and returns safe from afar.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 220

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** In like manner his good works receive him who has done good, and
  has gone from this world to the other;--as kinsmen receive a friend on
  his return.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

  ## 17. Anger

### 221

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let a man leave anger, let him forsake pride, let him overcome all
  bondage! No sufferings befall the man who is not attached to name and
  form, and who calls nothing his own.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 222

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who holds back rising anger like a rolling chariot, him I call a
  real driver; other people are but holding the reins.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 223

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let a man overcome anger by love, let him overcome evil by good;
  let him overcome the greedy by liberality, the liar by truth!

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 224

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Speak the truth, do not yield to anger; give, if thou art asked for
  little; by these three steps thou wilt go near the gods.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 225

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The sages who injure nobody, and who always control their body,
  they will go to the unchangeable place (Nirvana), where, if they have
  gone, they will suffer no more.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 226

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Those who are ever watchful, who study day and night, and who
  strive after Nirvana, their passions will come to an end.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 227

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** This is an old saying, O Atula, this is not only of to-day: `They
  blame him who sits silent, they blame him who speaks much, they also
  blame him who says little; there is no one on earth who is not blamed.'

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 228

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a man who
  is always blamed, or a man who is always praised.

**229 230** But he whom those who discriminate praise continually day
  after day, as without blemish, wise, rich in knowledge and virtue, who
  would dare to blame him, like a coin made of gold from the Gambu river?
  Even the gods praise him, he is praised even by Brahman.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 231

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Beware of bodily anger, and control thy body! Leave the sins of the
  body, and with thy body practise virtue!

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 232

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Beware of the anger of the tongue, and control thy tongue! Leave
  the sins of the tongue, and practise virtue with thy tongue!

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 233

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Beware of the anger of the mind, and control thy mind! Leave the
  sins of the mind, and practise virtue with thy mind!

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 234

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The wise who control their body, who control their tongue, the wise
  who control their mind, are indeed well controlled.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

  ## 18. Impurity

### 235

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Thou art now like a sear leaf, the messengers of death (Yama) have
  come near to thee; thou standest at the door of thy departure, and thou
  hast no provision for thy journey.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 236

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise! When thy impurities
  are blown away, and thou art free from guilt, thou wilt enter into the
  heavenly world of the elect (Ariya).

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 237

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Thy life has come to an end, thou art come near to death (Yama),
  there is no resting-place for thee on the road, and thou hast no
  provision for thy journey.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 238

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise! When thy impurities are
  blown away, and thou art free from guilt, thou wilt not enter again into
  birth and decay.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 239

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Let a wise man blow off the impurities of his self, as a smith
  blows off the impurities of silver one by one, little by little, and
  from time to time.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 240

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As the impurity which springs from the iron, when it springs from
  it, destroys it; thus do a transgressor's own works lead him to the evil
  path.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 241

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The taint of prayers is non-repetition; the taint of houses,
  non-repair; the taint of the body is sloth; the taint of a watchman,
  thoughtlessness.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 242

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Bad conduct is the taint of woman, greediness the taint of a
  benefactor; tainted are all evil ways in this world and in the next.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 243

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** But there is a taint worse than all taints,--ignorance is
  the greatest taint. O mendicants! throw off that taint, and become
  taintless!

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 244

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Life is easy to live for a man who is without shame, a crow hero, a
  mischief-maker, an insulting, bold, and wretched fellow.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 245

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** But life is hard to live for a modest man, who always looks for
  what is pure, who is disinterested, quiet, spotless, and intelligent.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 246

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who destroys life, who speaks untruth, who in this world takes
  what is not given him, who goes to another man's wife;

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 247

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** And the man who gives himself to drinking intoxicating liquors, he,
  even in this world, digs up his own root.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 248

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** O man, know this, that the unrestrained are in a bad state; take
  care that greediness and vice do not bring thee to grief for a long
  time!

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 249

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The world gives according to their faith or according to their
  pleasure: if a man frets about the food and the drink given to others,
  he will find no rest either by day or by night.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 250

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He in whom that feeling is destroyed, and taken out with the very
  root, finds rest by day and by night.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 251

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** There is no fire like passion, there is no shark like hatred, there
  is no snare like folly, there is no torrent like greed.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 252

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The fault of others is easily perceived, but that of oneself is
  difficult to perceive; a man winnows his neighbour's faults like chaff,
  but his own fault he hides, as a cheat hides the bad die from the
  gambler.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 253

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If a man looks after the faults of others, and is always inclined
  to be offended, his own passions will grow, and he is far from the
  destruction of passions.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 254

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** There is no path through the air, a man is not a Samana by outward
  acts. The world delights in vanity, the Tathagatas (the Buddhas) are
  free from vanity.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 255

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** There is no path through the air, a man is not a Samana by outward
  acts. No creatures are eternal; but the awakened (Buddha) are never
  shaken.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

  ## 19. The Just

**256 257** A man is not just if he carries a matter by violence; no, he
  who distinguishes both right and wrong, who is learned and leads others,
  not by violence, but by law and equity, and who is guarded by the law
  and intelligent, he is called just.

### 258

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A man is not learned because he talks much; he who is patient, free
  from hatred and fear, he is called learned.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 259

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A man is not a supporter of the law because he talks much; even if
  a man has learnt little, but sees the law bodily, he is a supporter of
  the law, a man who never neglects the law.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 260

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A man is not an elder because his head is grey; his age may be
  ripe, but he is called `Old-in-vain.'

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 261

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He in whom there is truth, virtue, love, restraint, moderation, he
  who is free from impurity and is wise, he is called an elder.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 262

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** An envious greedy, dishonest man does not become respectable by
  means of much talking only, or by the beauty of his complexion.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 263

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He in whom all this is destroyed, and taken out with the very root,
  he, when freed from hatred and wise, is called respectable.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 264

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Not by tonsure does an undisciplined man who speaks falsehood
  become a Samana; can a man be a Samana who is still held captive by
  desire and greediness?

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 265

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who always quiets the evil, whether small or large, he is called
  a Samana (a quiet man), because he has quieted all evil.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 266

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A man is not a mendicant (Bhikshu) simply because he asks others
  for alms; he who adopts the whole law is a Bhikshu, not he who only
  begs.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 267

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who is above good and evil, who is chaste, who with knowledge
  passes through the world, he indeed is called a Bhikshu.

**268 269** A man is not a Muni because he observes silence (mona, i.e.
  mauna), if he is foolish and ignorant; but the wise who, taking the
  balance, chooses the good and avoids evil, he is a Muni, and is a Muni
  thereby; he who in this world weighs both sides is called a Muni.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 270

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A man is not an elect (Ariya) because he injures living creatures;
  because he has pity on all living creatures, therefore is a man called
  Ariya.

**271 272** Not only by discipline and vows, not only by much learning,
  not by entering into a trance, not by sleeping alone, do I earn the
  happiness of release which no worldling can know. Bhikshu, be not
  confident as long as thou hast not attained the extinction of desires.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

  ## 20. The Way

### 273

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The best of ways is the eightfold; the best of truths the four
  words; the best of virtues passionlessness; the best of men he who has
  eyes to see.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 274

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** This is the way, there is no other that leads to the purifying of
  intelligence. Go on this way! Everything else is the deceit of Mara (the
  tempter).

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 275

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If you go on this way, you will make an end of pain! The way was
  preached by me, when I had understood the removal of the thorns (in the
  flesh).

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 276

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** You yourself must make an effort. The Tathagatas (Buddhas) are only
  preachers. The thoughtful who enter the way are freed from the bondage
  of Mara.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 277

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** `All created things perish,' he who knows and sees this becomes
  passive in pain; this is the way to purity.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 278

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** `All created things are grief and pain,' he who knows and sees this
  becomes passive in pain; this is the way that leads to purity.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 279

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** `All forms are unreal,' he who knows and sees this becomes passive
  in pain; this is the way that leads to purity.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 280

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who does not rouse himself when it is time to rise, who, though
  young and strong, is full of sloth, whose will and thought are weak,
  that lazy and idle man will never find the way to knowledge.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 281

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Watching his speech, well restrained in mind, let a man never
  commit any wrong with his body! Let a man but keep these three roads of
  action clear, and he will achieve the way which is taught by the wise.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 282

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Through zeal knowledge is gotten, through lack of zeal knowledge is
  lost; let a man who knows this double path of gain and loss thus place
  himself that knowledge may grow.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 283

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Cut down the whole forest (of lust), not a tree only! Danger comes
  out of the forest (of lust). When you have cut down both the forest (of
  lust) and its undergrowth, then, Bhikshus, you will be rid of the forest
  and free!

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 284

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** So long as the love of man towards women, even the smallest, is not
  destroyed, so long is his mind in bondage, as the calf that drinks milk
  is to its mother.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 285

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Cut out the love of self, like an autumn lotus, with thy hand!
  Cherish the road of peace. Nirvana has been shown by Sugata (Buddha).

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 286

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** `Here I shall dwell in the rain, here in winter and summer,' thus
  the fool meditates, and does not think of his death.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 287

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Death comes and carries off that man, praised for his children and
  flocks, his mind distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 288

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Sons are no help, nor a father, nor relations; there is no help
  from kinsfolk for one whom death has seized.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 289

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A wise and good man who knows the meaning of this, should quickly
  clear the way that leads to Nirvana.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

  ## 21. Miscellaneous

  wise man leave the small pleasure, and look to the great.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 291

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who, by causing pain to others, wishes to obtain pleasure for
  himself, he, entangled in the bonds of hatred, will never be free from
  hatred.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 292

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** What ought to be done is neglected, what ought not to be done is
  done; the desires of unruly, thoughtless people are always increasing.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 293

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** But they whose whole watchfulness is always directed to their body,
  who do not follow what ought not to be done, and who steadfastly do what
  ought to be done, the desires of such watchful and wise people will come
  to an end.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 294

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A true Brahmana goes scatheless, though he have killed father and
  mother, and two valiant kings, though he has destroyed a kingdom with
  all its subjects.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 295

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** A true Brahmana goes scatheless, though he have killed father and
  mother, and two holy kings, and an eminent man besides.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 296

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The disciples of Gotama (Buddha) are always well awake, and their
  thoughts day and night are always set on Buddha.

  and night always delights in compassion.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 301

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their mind day
  and night always delights in meditation.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 302

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** It is hard to leave the world (to become a friar), it is hard to
  enjoy the world; hard is the monastery, painful are the houses; painful
  it is to dwell with equals (to share everything in common) and the
  itinerant mendicant is beset with pain. Therefore let no man be an
  itinerant mendicant and he will not be beset with pain.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 303

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Whatever place a faithful, virtuous, celebrated, and wealthy man
  chooses, there he is respected.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 304

**[PALI]**

  are not seen, like arrows shot by night.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 305

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He alone who, without ceasing, practises the duty of sitting
  alone and sleeping alone, he, subduing himself, will rejoice in the
  destruction of all desires alone, as if living in a forest.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

  ## 22. The Downward Course

### 306

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** He who says what is not, goes to hell; he also who, having done a
  thing, says I have not done it. After death both are equal, they are men
  with evil deeds in the next world.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 307

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Many men whose shoulders are covered with the yellow gown are
  ill-conditioned and unrestrained; such evil-doers by their evil deeds go
  to hell.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 308

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Better it would be to swallow a heated iron ball, like flaring
  fire, than that a bad unrestrained fellow should live on the charity of
  the land.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 309

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Four things does a wreckless man gain who covets his neighbour's
  wife,--a bad reputation, an uncomfortable bed, thirdly, punishment, and
  lastly, hell.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 310

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** There is bad reputation, and the evil way (to hell), there is the
  short pleasure of the frightened in the arms of the frightened, and
  the king imposes heavy punishment; therefore let no man think of his
  neighbour's wife.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 311

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As a grass-blade, if badly grasped, cuts the arm, badly-practised
  asceticism leads to hell.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 312

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** An act carelessly performed, a broken vow, and hesitating obedience
  to discipline, all this brings no great reward.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 313

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** If anything is to be done, let a man do it, let him attack it
  vigorously! A careless pilgrim only scatters the dust of his passions
  more widely.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 314

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** An evil deed is better left undone, for a man repents of it
  afterwards; a good deed is better done, for having done it, one does not
  repent.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 315

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Like a well-guarded frontier fort, with defences within and
  without, so let a man guard himself. Not a moment should escape, for
  they who allow the right moment to pass, suffer pain when they are in
  hell.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 316

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** They who are ashamed of what they ought not to be ashamed of, and
  are not ashamed of what they ought to be ashamed of, such men, embracing
  false doctrines enter the evil path.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 317

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** They who fear when they ought not to fear, and fear not when they
  ought to fear, such men, embracing false doctrines, enter the evil path.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 318

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** They who forbid when there is nothing to be forbidden, and forbid
  not when there is something to be forbidden, such men, embracing false
  doctrines, enter the evil path.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 319

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** They who know what is forbidden as forbidden, and what is not
  forbidden as not forbidden, such men, embracing the true doctrine, enter
  the good path.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 338

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** As a tree, even though it has been cut down, is firm so long as its

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 345

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Wise people do not call that a strong fetter which is made of iron,

  extinction of thirst overcomes all pain.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 355

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** Pleasures destroy the foolish, if they look not for the other
  shore; the foolish by his thirst for pleasures destroys himself, as if
  he were his own enemy.

**[TIN]**

**[BHIKKU]**

### 356

**[PALI]**

**[MÜLLER]** The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by passion:
  therefore a gift bestowed on the passionless brings great reward.
