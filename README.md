# Dhammapada

Updated and improved gender-neutral interpretation of the ancient Buddhist text, the Dhammapada. 

From the [Dhammapada Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhammapada) : 

> The Dhammapada (Pāli; Prakrit: धम्मपद Dhammapada;[1]) is a collection of sayings of the Buddha in verse form and one of the most widely read and best known Buddhist scriptures.[2] The original version of the Dhammapada is in the Khuddaka Nikaya, a division of the Pali Canon of Theravada Buddhism.

## Re-translation goals

My primary goal is to update the F. Max Muller-edited translation from Project Gutenberg to have gender neutral pronouns and language, rather than the he/him/his male-default used by the 1881 translators ("Various Oriental Scholars"). 

Buddhism is a religion for everyone, be they men, women or non-binary folks. The history of Women in Buddhism is not a smooth one, but equality in and outside the monastic tradition is the only version of this philosophy that makes sense to me as a student. I believe this seminal document should be read as addressing each individual personally and in a way that is directly applicable to their lives. As such there is no reason for male-centered language and pronoun use in the Dhammapada, and a free and open gender-neutral version is badly lacking.

I am using GitHub for this endeavor with the goal of having re-interprative transparency, so that any changes I make are clear and unambiguous to anyone who wants to audit my choices. Additionally, GitHub will allow other students to easily fork my copy and make their own edits, which I will certainly consider integrating back into my version via. pull requests if I recieve them. 

In addition to the gendered-language changes, I may also incorporate some modern re-interpretations of the original Pali (i.e. alternate translations of key words or phrases) for the purposes of social justice or general clarity. I will avoid making such changes as much as possible though, because I am not an expert in Pali, Buddhism or translation. My goal is to keep the "authority" of the 1881 Pali to English translation in theological and linguistic matters, while cleaning up the gendered language which I consider a socio-political necessity. 

In the long run I hope to re-record my version as a Librivox audiobook to compete with the current LibriVox versions of the Dhammapada ([Version 1](https://librivox.org/the-dhammapada-translated-by-f-max-mueller/), [Version 2](https://librivox.org/the-dhammapada-version-2-by-unknown/)) , which have many technical and stylistic issues in addition to the problematic male-centered pronoun usage.

Specific titles for this retranslation that I might use are **"Social Justive Dhammapada"**, **"Inclusive Dhammapada"** or **"Dhammapada 2018"**. All should give a sense of what I'm going for. Ultimately though, this is simply the Dhammapada, revised to use simple lanaguge that applies to a modern audience.  

## My re-translation has no direct relationhip with the Gil Fronstal version

For a commercially-available Dhammapada with similar goals see the [2005 retranslation by Gil Fronsdal](https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59030-211-8), which I have not read and do not plan to read, but uses gender neutral language also. 

My goal is to create a free version that may be read by anyone, both in that it will be free and in that it will speak to readers with pronouns that are not alienating based on gender. 

## About the F. Max Müller version 

Original starting point for this Dhammapada is the Project Gutenberg TXT version here: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2017

Background info about the Gutenberg version

Note that while Project Gutenberg lists the author as "Unknown", the traditionally-assumed author of the Dhammapada is Siddhārtha Gautama himself, "the Buddha". That said, it was transcribed years after his death based on oral tradition, and thus those who worked on the transcription are no longer known. 

## Release date of source translation

For some reason, the Project Gutenberg page completely omits the release date of "The Sacred Books of the East" Vol X. Based on this [archive.org copy of Vol X](https://archive.org/stream/SacredBooksEastVariousOrientalScholarsWithIndex.50VolsMaxMuller/10.SacredBooksEast.VarOrSch.v10.Muller.Bud.Mull.Fausb.p1.Dhamm.p2.SutNip.TrPali.Oxf.1881.#page/n9/mode/2up), it seems the original publishing date was 1881: 

The overall multi-volumne ["The Sacred Books of the East" "Revised" edition on Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12894/12894-h/12894-h.htm), which seems to be the specific source for F. Max Muller's Dhammapada used on Project Gutenbert, states "1900" on it's first page.
